# SparkSample
This is sample of how you can implement a Spark analytic in Java.

This sample uses a csv input file, of a stock, and shows how to use the RDD and functions in Spark.

There are not too many Java examples available for what I was looking for.  So I made my own just as
a launching point into running Spark applications.

Please note, Spark 1.3.0 depends on Java 1.7 or later.  So please make sure you have the right version of java installed first.
